This is assignment 1 of Web-development project.
In this assignment, i used fontawesome to import icons and i took images from google.
With the help of MDN reference i learned some styling techniques and used them in this assignment.
Using div tags i created 3 parts two side bars and products page.
I used span tag for price and for superscript 4.
I linked style.css with index.html to work in external css.
I used arial font.
I took flex direction row in body and flex direction column in sub parts.
I used some transitions, transform, box shadow and hovering.
I used cursor pointer for icons and buttons.
Remaining i used normal properties.
I used @media() for responsiveness.
